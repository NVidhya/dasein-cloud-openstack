dasein-cloud-openstack
======================

The Dasein Cloud OpenStack submodule to the [Dasein Cloud](https://github.com/greese/dasein-cloud) project. It provides
an implementation of the Dasein Cloud API for all OpenStack versions and distributions. It includes core OpenStack functionality
as well as extensions for the Rackspace Cloud, the HP Cloud, and others.

_NOTE: If you want to interact with the EC2 API, you will need to use [dasein-cloud-aws](https://github.com/greese/dasein-cloud-aws)._
